## Overview

This application is a home assessment project built by David Wang.

I have built a list where items can be dragged and dropped.

I considered maintainability and scalability and you can customize the items which are displayed in the list element.

I followed details of Figma design and the application is working on mobile as well.

I used the most recent version of Next.js and Tailwind CSS and also DnD-kit to implement drag-and-drop functionality.

The code is well structured and formatted. There are comments to help you understand the codebase.

Further considersation(if I get more time):

- Automated testing with Jest or React testing library
- Use TypeScript
- Docker containerization
- CI/CD

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
